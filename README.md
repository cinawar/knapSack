KnapSack Dynamic Approach

The Knapsack Problem is a well known problem of combinatorial optimization. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, we must determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value must be maximized.

Designing an Item Model
First, start by designing an Item for the Knapsack Problem. An Item will have the following properties :
index helping us to identify it
weight representing the weight of the item
price representing the value of the item

Solving Strategy of the Knapsack Problem
To solve the Knapsack Problem, Dynamic Programming Algorithm is using.

Test 
Junit test cases are under test/java folder. In order to check, file processing, item processing and check result with the given output.
